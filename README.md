> **From Chaos to Canon. Locally.**

[中文说明](./README.zh.md)

Synnia is an open-source **Digital Asset Consistency Engine** and management tool. We define "Digital Assets" as images, text, or multimodal combinations of both.

## Core Philosophy

Synnia's philosophy is inspired by node-based workflows but with a fundamental shift:

*   **Synnia (Asset-as-Node)**: Nodes represent the **Digital Assets** themselves (entities).
*   **ComfyUI (Function-as-Node)**: Traditional nodes represent **functions** or processing steps.

## Why Synnia?

Synnia features built-in Agents that act as bridges to external AI capabilities. You can generate and extend text or images by calling APIs from any model you prefer.

Synnia is implementation-agnostic; its core purpose is to provide a **Global Vision (Brand/IP Level)**. As a consistency engine, it ensures that as your assets are generated and expanded, they maintain a cohesive style, setting, and logic.

Synnia is designed to help you manage and expand your creative universe if you are an:
*   Indie Developer
*   Brand Designer
*   Writer
*   Manga Artist

## Key Features

*   **Consistency Engine**: Provides Brand/IP-level consistency assurance for all expanded content.
*   **Model Agnostic**: Connect to any AI model API via built-in Agents.
*   **Privacy First**: 100% Local storage. Your creativity belongs to you.
