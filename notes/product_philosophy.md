# Synnia Product Philosophy

> "Let AI use AI. Let heroes find heroes."

Synnia is not just another canvas tool. It is a paradigm shift in how we manage generative creativity.

## 1. Asset as Node (The Structure)
*   **Assets are Living Entities**: Not static files in a folder, but nodes in a dependency graph.
*   **Context Aware**: Every asset knows where it came from (Lineage) and what it influences (Impact).
*   **Consistency Engine**: When an upstream asset changes (e.g., character setting), downstream assets (e.g., illustrations) are marked as "Outdated", ensuring global consistency.

## 2. Prompt as Asset (The Recipe)
*   **Prompts are Source Code**: In the GenAI era, prompts are the code that compiles into media.
*   **Reusability**: A single "Style Prompt Node" can drive thousands of image generations.
*   **Version Control**: Managing prompts with the same rigor as software code.

## 3. AI using AI (The Agency)
*   **User as Commander**: Users define intent and constraints.
*   **Agent as Middleware**: Agents bridge the gap between human intent and raw model capabilities (ComfyUI/LLMs).
*   **Complexity Encapsulation**: Agents handle the intricate parameter tuning, workflow construction, and error handling, presenting only high-level choices to the user.
*   **Self-Refinement**: Agents can inspect their own outputs (using Vision models) and iterate before showing results to the user.

## The Core Value Proposition
Synnia transforms **"Chaos"** (scattered files, forgotten prompts, disconnected workflows) into **"Canon"** (a structured, consistent, and growing creative universe).
